                Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
                population with some countries and entities actively fighting
                against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
                holding the fort. </p>
                <p>
                 Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown
                to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or
                the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is
                to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it
                down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it
                in simple words to their followers and have them download an
                app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and
                watch their investment as is with other crypto currency project.</p>
                <p>
                We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for
                the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital
                currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to
                understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being
                the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this
                space a real look.

                A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as
                powerful as countries and creators would be paid beyond the
                peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.
               </p>
               <p>
                There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer
                would not find home there. Like Kanye said,
